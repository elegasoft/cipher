# Cryptanalysis Conversation with a LLM AI
I was curious to provide myself with more context regarding the security of this cipher and engaged in the following chat with a Large-Large-Model based AI Chat Bot which resulted in the following exchange.

## Chat
#### User Prompt: 
Given the following how would one calculate the difficulty of breaking the cipher?

```
### How does it work? (simplified example)

A cipher uses a substitute alphabet to replace plain text characters with a replacement character from the cipher
alphabet. This cipher can use a different cipher alphabet for each character in the plain text string.

Using `Base62Cipher::encifer('Hello!')` and only 3 cipher keys the following would occur:

1) plain text "H" is the 32nd character in the `Base62` character set and it would be replaced with the 32nd character
   in the `first cipher key`
2) plain text "e" is the 5th character in the `Base62` character set and it would be replaced with the 5th character in
   the `second cipher key`
3) plain text "l" is the 12th character in the `Base62` character set and it would be replaced with the 12th character
   in the `third cipher key`
4) plain text "l" is the 12th character in the `Base62` character set and it would be replaced with the 12th character
   in the `second cipher key`
5) plain text "o" is the 15th character in the `Base62` character set and it would be replaced with the 15th character
   in the `third cipher key`
5) plain text "!" would not be replaced as it is not found in the `Base62` character set, however if it were a
   replaceable character the replacement would occur in the `first cipher key`

### How does it really work?

If you take the simplified example above the first character would be enciphered exactly as provided, however, going
forward to the "e" character and forward from there. Before replacing the "e" with the character in the 5th position,
the cipher key would be rotated sequentially until the "H" character is at the 0 index position. Then the character at
the 5th position would be chosen. The cipher would continue switching key stream and rotating them until the previous
character is at the 0 index position before selecting the next character until reaching the end of the string.

This behavior increases the complexity of deciphering with little computational effort as strings starting with
different characters will yield wildly different results.
```

#### Response by AI Chat Bot: 
Given the description, deciphering that ciphertext without the proper keys would indeed be tremendously difficult. The reason for that is because of the complex nature of the cipher's method of encryption, where characters from different keys are used in a rotated manner making the cipher extremely secure against attacks. It's not enough to know which character substitutes which, but you also need to know in which precise order and rotation the keys were used.

Attempting to break this cipher through brute force (i.e. trying all possible combinations of characters and keys) would require a significant amount of computational power and time. Assuming a character set of size 62 (as per Base62), and a three-key setup as described in the example, the number of potential combinations would be (62 factorial) raised to the power of the length of the text for each key. 

This is because every character from the Base62 set could theoretically have any other character from that same set as its substitution, leading to a whooping number of 62 factorial possibilities. And that's just for one key. Given the three-key setup being used, that number is raised to the power of three (62 factorial) ^ 3. After which, the result will once again need to be raised to the power equal to the length of the text because each character substitution could potentially come from any key.

In short, the effort to break the cipher by brute force would be extremely high due to the exponential increase in the key space with each additional character in the text. This effectively makes the cipher extremely secure against such attacks.

For a more mathematical calculation please refer to the shannon's formula for perfect secrecy: `H(K|C) = H(K)`, where `H(K|C)` is the entropy of the key knowing the ciphertext and `H(K)` is the entropy of the key. This would require a deep understanding of information theory though. 

Please note that the calculation above is a gross oversimplification and does not take into account other factors like frequency analysis and potential vulnerabilities in the key generation process that could lower the required effort.

#### User Prompt: 
If the attacker does not know how many keys are being used would that further complicate the issue?

#### Response by AI Chat Bot: 
Absolutely, not knowing the number of keys used would undoubtedly further complicate attempts at brute-forcing the cipher. If an attacker doesn't know the number of keys, they would have to try combinations accounting for different numbers of keys. This greatly increases the time, complexity and computational resources required to brute-force the cipher.

For the calculation above, we assumed a fixed number of keys (three, in the example). If the number of keys is not known, the attacker needs to consider scenarios with different numbers of keys, which adds additional layers of complexity.

To give you an idea of scale, if a 4th key is added all of the calculations would need to be increased exponentially to account for another set of 62 characters. Going by the earlier estimate, the total number of possible combinations would then be (62 factorial) raised to the power of the length of the text for each key (potentially raised to the power of 4). As you can see, each additional key significantly increases the difficulty of a brute force attack.

This is the principle behind the security of many encryption algorithms -- the keyspace (all possible keys) is so vast that it is virtually impossible to try all of them in a reasonable timeframe, even with powerful computing resources.

But cryptography is not only about key space, it's also about implementation, randomness, no data leak and many other aspects. A large key space can give an idea of the security of the cryptography, but you also need to consider other potential vulnerabilities and threats when evaluating a cryptographic system.

#### User Prompt: 
What would the entropy be for a four character string and 3 keys?

#### Response by AI Chat Bot: 
If we have a four-character string and each character can be ciphered using 3 different keys, making a total of 62 characters per key (as base62 is used), then we can compute the entropy as follows:

Entropy per character, H, is given by the formula:

H = log2(62^3)

This essentially says that for each character you have 62^3 different possibilities given that there are 3 keys, each with 62 possible characters.

For the total four-character string, the entropy would be four times the per-character entropy since each character has the same entropy and the characters are independently encrypted.

Total_Entropy = 4 * log2(62^3)

By calculating this, we get:

Total_Entropy ≈ 4 * 34.219 ≈ 136.876 bits

The value represents the logarithm base 2 of the number of all possible combinations, which represents the uncertainty or randomness of the encryption system. The higher the entropy, the more secure the system is against brute-force attacks, assuming a perfectly implemented system.

#### User Prompt: 
How does that entropy compare to some well known algorithms?

#### Response by AI Chat Bot: 
The entropy of the encryption mechanism you mentioned is roughly 136.88 bits for a 4 character string. This value represents a measure of the uncertainty, randomness, or complexity in the encryption scheme. The higher the entropy, the more secure the cipher is against brute-force attacks.

As a comparison, let's take a look at some well-known algorithms:

1. *AES-128*: As the name implies, this well-known symmetric algorithm uses a key of 128 bits. Therefore, the key space is 2^128, and the entropy would be 128 bits.

2. *AES-256*: This version of AES uses a 256-bit key, so its entropy is 256 bits.

3. *RSA-2048*: A widely used public key algorithm. While the numbers used are 2048 bits long, the security provided by RSA-2048 is often considered less than its key size, typically providing about 112 bits of security.

All these values represent the entropy given the keys are chosen randomly from the complete range of possible keys. 

Comparing these with our cipher, it can be considered quite decent given that it provides roughly 137 bits of entropy for a string length of only `4` characters. However, please note that security of an encryption method doesn't only depend on its entropy - other factors like randomness, key management, and potential vulnerabilities in the implementation can impact their real-world security.


#### User Prompt: 
I know that there are hash tables which can be used to crack certain algorithms, as this algorithm will certainly provide patterns for example:

```text
### Uniqueness and Dealing with Sequential Inputs

As this is simply a cipher and not a hashing algorithm, each input should produce a singular output. I have run a number
of simulations of up to a million different inputs and have not found any repetition. However, there are noticeable
trends which may result if you send it sequential inputs which will result in similar outputs.

For example this was a recognized pattern:

```php
$cipher = new Base62Cipher(config('ciphers.keys.base62'))
$cipher->encipher('aaaaaaaa') // Outputs tW7vz1pT
$cipher->encipher('aaaaaaab') // Outputs tW7vz1pu
$cipher->encipher('aaaaaaac') // Outputs tW7vz1pn
$cipher->encipher('aaaaaaad') // Outputs tW7vz1p7
```

Therefore, if the attacker new the character key base was 62 wouldn't it be trivial to use a hash table to identify the keys?

#### Response by AI Chat Bot: 
It's true that if an encryption algorithm produces different ciphertexts based on slight variations of the plaintext, then this could potentially allow an attacker to use a sort of lookup table to speed up brute-force attempts, or even apply cryptanalysis techniques to decipher the plaintext without knowing the secret keys. 

However, keep in mind that for the attacker to build such a table, they would still need to generate all possible combinations for different input plaintexts, which could be computationally intensive and time-consuming given the large key space of the Base62 set and multiple keys used in the cipher.

In the specific example you provided, knowing that slight changes in the input ('aaaaaaab' vs 'aaaaaaac') result in slight changes in the output, does indeed provide some information about the internal workings of the cipher. However, it's also important to remember the sequential and rotating use of the different cipher keys. This introduces an additional level of complexity, as the same plaintext character doesn't always result in the same ciphertext character.

Furthermore, even if an attacker could identify that one character in the key corresponds to another in the plaintext, they may not be able to discern the order and rotation of the keys. In this sense, each character's encryption is not entirely independent but is affected by the preceding characters due to the rotating nature of the keys, therefore reducing the chances of successful cryptanalysis using a hash table.

Thus, while this potential pattern might offer some advantages to an attacker, it doesn't necessarily make cracking the cipher "trivial". In fact, with modern encryption standards, even minuscule amounts of repeated structures/patterns in the ciphertext or key space are usually enough to compromise the whole cipher, hence no secure modern cipher should have this property.
